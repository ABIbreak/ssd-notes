# Week 5: February 16th - 22nd

## Wednesday
- Verus support for spec functions seems a bit goofy?
- Attempted to prove a tail-recursive factorial implementation correct via
  equivalence between a tail-recursive and normal factorial spec, then
  equivalence between the tail-recursive implementation and spec
- Went nowhere, so followed the 'recipe' in the tutorial and proved
  the tail-recursive implementation directly from the normal factorial spec
- First attempt had lots of quantifiers, while second had none; should orient
  towards avoiding them
