# Week 5: February 16th - 22nd

## Wednesday
- Verus support for spec functions seems a bit goofy?
- Attempted to prove a tail-recursive factorial implementation correct via
  equivalence between a tail-recursive and normal factorial spec, then
  equivalence between the tail-recursive implementation and spec
- Since spec functions can't have requires/ensures clauses, that idea went 
  nowhere
- By following the 'recipe' in the tutorial, I was able to prove the 
  tail-recursive implementation directly from the normal factorial spec
- First attempt had lots of quantifiers, while second had none; should orient
  towards avoiding them

## Thursday
- Messed around for a few hours trying to get the kernel to not use a portion
  of physical memory by attempting to pass a memmap argument via GRUB to no 
  avail
- This is part of the setup for NVMeVirt, since I figured I could replace the
  reference FTL with a verified version instead of having to tranfer from
  FEMU to NVMeVirt

## Friday
- Fixed memmap issue; turns out that the arguments are not passed via GRUB
  but something hypervisor specific
- Also should check ```/proc/iomem``` to see if it works, since it isn't 
  reflected in the e820 BIOS memory map 
  (checkable with ```sudo dmesg | grep e820```)
- Debugged kernel crashes; mostly due to a combination of stupid mistakes
  (passing ```isolcpus=7,8``` instead of ```cpu=7,8```, passing fewer than 2
  CPUs), and a lack of consistency checks on the part of the module
- Should probably fix the lack of consistency checks, since it wasted a few
  hours
