# PoWER

## Notes
- Preconditions on writes lead to crash-consistent state 
- Natural model: current readable state, set of outstanding writes
- Prophecy model: readable and durable state

## Questions
- In-place writes appear to be poorly defined?
  A read observing a write that is lost due to crashing is a consequence of write caching?
